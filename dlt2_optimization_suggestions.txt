Optimization Suggestions for dlt2 Function
==========================================

1. Inner Integration Loop Hotspot
---------------------------------
- The double loop over `i` and `j` (each of size `n`) results in n^2 iterations.
- `ff(tau_minus, ptcs)` is called inside the innermost loop and may be expensive.
- Optimization:
  * Inline or approximate `ff()` if possible.
  * Precompute values of `ff()` if `tau_minus` and `ptcs` vary over a limited range.

2. simpson_2d_integrate_flat Overhead
-------------------------------------
- Could be a performance bottleneck if it includes checks for grid uniformity or branching.
- Optimization:
  * Inline the function for performance-critical paths.
  * Use a specialized version if the integration grid is always uniform.

3. Redundant Calculations
--------------------------
- `ff1_cache[idx][pp] = ff(tau_minus, p * cs);` is repeated for every (i, j, pp).
- Optimization:
  * Precompute `p_cs_vals[pp] = p * cs` once and use it.

- `ptcs = pt * cs` is recalculated for every (k, p, z).
- Optimization:
  * If `ptilde(k, p, z)` is expensive, consider caching `ptcs`.

4. Loop Ordering
----------------
- The order of `kk`, `pp`, `zz` loops matters due to memory access patterns and cache locality.
- Optimization:
  * Place the fastest-varying (largest) loop innermost for better cache usage.
  * Profile dimensions of `nk`, `np`, and `nz`. If `nk` is largest, make `kk` innermost.

5. OpenMP Parallelism
---------------------
- `#pragma omp for collapse(3)` might not scale well if one of the dimensions is small.
- Optimization:
  * Avoid collapsing all three loops if dimensions vary widely.
  * Consider dynamic scheduling or reordering loops to better balance load across threads.

Summary
-------
- Inline or cache heavy function calls.
- Reorder loops based on data size for cache efficiency.
- Optimize OpenMP usage by tuning loop structure and scheduling.
